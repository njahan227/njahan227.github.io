        <h1> Ethics in Data Science </h1>
        <div class="ethics"> 
        <p>
            Ethics in data science refers to the guildlines and ethical principles data scientists and developers need to properly maintain 
            to effectively collect, process, and analyze data as well as use the applications with machine learning. Some of the ethical
            issues data scientists should consider include:
            <ol type="1">
                <li> <b>Privacy:</b> Data scientists should avoid the collection of unnecessary user data to safeguard privacy. </li>
                <li> <b> Fairness: </b> For ensuring equitable and fair outcomes, data scientists must avoid potential biases. </li>
                <li> <b> Transparency:</b> To ensure transparency in data collection, clearly stated collection, usage and analyzing of data should be provided. </li>
                <li> <b> Accountability:</b> Data scientists should take the responsibility of their actions and societal impact. </li>
                <li> <b> Avoid Harm:</b> To prevent negative consequences and stereotypes, data scientists should keep that under consideration while creating models.</li>
                <li> <b> Consent:</b> Every time any kinds of user data is collected and used, proper consent must be taken from the users prior. </li>
                <li> <b> Security:</b> Last but not the least, ensuring proper security measures to protect user data from data theft and vulnerabilities is a must for proper ethical framework in data science.</li>
            </ol>
            Similar to data scientists, developers need to follow some guildlines as well to be alligned with the ethical principles of data science. Some of them as follows:
            <ol type="I">
                <li> <b> Secure Coding Practice:</b> Developers should implement strong security measures like encryption while writing codes to ensure secure coding.</li>
                <li> <b> Respecting User Privacy:</b> Developers should collect only the necessary data from users to protect privacy and confidentiality of their data.</li>
                <li> <b> Regular Testing:</b> Developers should always perform routine testing of software to check for potential errors and bugs.</li>
                <li> <b> Maintaing Code Quality:</b> Developers need to always prioritize writing codes that are clear, well- documented and maintainable.</li>
                <li> <b> Stay Updated:</b> Staying up to date with ethical standards, guildlines and recent changes in the technology should be on the top of the list of things developers need to abide by.</li>
            </ol>
